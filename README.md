# Paper reading notebook

This is my paper reading notebook project. Currenty, I archive my reading notes by creating issues:

- Closed issues are read and archived.

- Opened issues are papers have not been read.


You are welcome to dicuss each paper with me by leaving your comments under your insterested papers. 
You are also welcome to read the papers listed in open issues and write summaries for these papers.
