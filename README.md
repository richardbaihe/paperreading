# Paper reading notebook

This is my paper reading note project. Currenty, I archive my reading notes by creating issues:

- Closed issues are read and archived.

- Opened issues are papers have not been read or will not be read.


You are welcome to dicuss each paper with me by leaving your comments under your insterested papers. 
You can also read the papers listed in open issues and write summaries for these papers.
